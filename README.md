# How to use the code?
1.Setup your python env according to the requirements.txt <br>
2.Create a folder named "models", download and unzip models_texify.zip to the folder "models" from release page v1.3<br>
3.Create a folder named "texmml", download and unzip texmml.zip to the folder "texmml" from release page v1.2<br>
4.Just run the ocr_gui.py <br>
I've tried my best to simplify the code and preject,so it's easy to modify the GUI and intergrate other OCR model to this. <br>

# Potential issues
It will consume much time if you snip a very large image.<br>
Some format errors in MathML because it's tranformed from latex.I've tried to solve most of them.<br>
Sometimes, there can be formatting issues with curly braces <br>
Some letters or symbols cannot be recognized because not in the token vocabulary or training set.<br>
If you find any other issues，contact me.I'll keep updating this if necessary.

# A cup of coffee for the author
